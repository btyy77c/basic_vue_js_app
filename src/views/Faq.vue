        Hurricane Dorian 101 is a project that was created and founded by
        Elizabeth Davis, Everett Duke, Emily Ring, India Scheck, Justin
        Williams, and Juvie Yurina. This project was created to help with
        natural disaster relief efforts, which will help provide for people who
        were affected by hurricane Dorian and future disasters. Our goal is to
        provide victims with food, water, and clothing and help rebuild homes
        with the money that is collected through our website.
